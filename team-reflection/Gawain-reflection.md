Below,
briefly describe the specific contributions each team member
made to your project (**including yourself**).
Point form is fine.
Specifically,
comment on the following areas:

- How the team worked together as a whole, including:
    - What was your role in the group?
      That is, what sort of things did you do to contribute to the evolution of the project?
    - What were the roles of others in your group?
- What went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?
